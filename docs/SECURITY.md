# üîê SonarLink - Security Policy

**Sonarlink - Private file transfer, powered by sound**

## Release Verification

All SonarLink releases are cryptographically signed with GPG to ensure authenticity and integrity.

### How to Verify a Release

#### Step 1: Import the Public Key (First Time Only)

```bash
# Download the public key
curl -O https://github.com/marianopeluso/sonarlink/raw/main/sonarlink-public-key.asc

# Import it into GPG
gpg --import sonarlink-public-key.asc
```

#### Step 2: Download the Release Files

```bash
# Download from GitHub Releases
VERSION="1.0.0"
BASE_URL="https://github.com/marianopeluso/sonarlink/releases/download/v${VERSION}"

# Download archive and signature
curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/sonarlink-v${VERSION}.zip"
curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/sonarlink-v${VERSION}.zip.asc"
curl -LO "${BASE_URL}/sonarlink-v${VERSION}.zip.sha256"
```

#### Step 3: Verify the GPG Signature

```bash
gpg --verify sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip.asc sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip
```

**Expected output:**
```
gpg: Signature made [DATE]
gpg:                using RSA key [KEY_ID]
gpg: Good signature from "Mariano Peluso <mariano@peluso.me>" [unknown]
```

‚úÖ **"Good signature"** means the file is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

‚ö†Ô∏è The warning `[unknown]` is normal and means you haven't personally verified the key owner's identity. This is acceptable for open-source projects.

#### Step 4: Verify the Checksum

```bash
# Verify SHA-256
sha256sum -c sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip.sha256

# Or manually compare
sha256sum sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip
cat sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip.sha256
```

**Expected output:**
```
sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip: OK
```

### Windows Users

**Install GPG:**
1. Download Gpg4win: https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html
2. Install with default options

**Verify signature:**
```cmd
gpg --verify sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip.asc sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip
```

**Verify checksum (without GPG):**
```cmd
certutil -hashfile sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip SHA256
```
Compare the output with the hash in `sonarlink-v1.0.0.zip.sha256`

## Security Best Practices

When using SonarLink:

1. **Verify every release** before installation
2. **Use strong passwords** for encrypted transfers
3. **Keep audio devices secure** during sensitive transfers
4. **Verify recipients** before sending encrypted files
5. **Update regularly** to get security patches

- ‚ùå Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've patched it
- ‚ùå Exploit the vulnerability maliciously

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Target:** Within 30-90 days (depending on severity)

### Hall of Fame

We'll acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

*No reports yet - be the first!*

## Known Security Considerations

### Audio Transmission Security

1. **Physical Security**: Audio transfers can be intercepted by anyone who can hear the transmission. Use encryption for sensitive data.

2. **Encryption Recommendations**:
   - Use **AES-256** for general file encryption
   - Use **RSA-2048** for maximum security
   - Always use unique passwords/passphrases

3. **Room Acoustics**: Be aware of your environment when transmitting sensitive data via audio.

### Dependencies

SonarLink relies on several third-party libraries. We monitor them for vulnerabilities:
- `pyaudio` - Audio I/O
- `ggwave-wheels` - Audio modulation/demodulation
- `cryptography` - Encryption implementation
- `numpy` - Data processing

Run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` regularly to get security updates.

## Cryptographic Details

### Encryption Algorithms

**AES-256-CFB Mode:**
- Key size: 256 bits
- IV: 16 bytes (randomly generated)
- Authentication: HMAC-SHA256

**RSA-OAEP:**
- Key size: 2048 bits
- Padding: OAEP with SHA-256
- Compatible with OpenSSL

### Random Number Generation

SonarLink uses `os.urandom()` for cryptographic random number generation, which is:
- Suitable for cryptographic use
- Platform-specific (e.g., `/dev/urandom` on Linux)
- Non-blocking
