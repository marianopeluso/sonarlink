**Sonarlink - Private file transfer, powered by sound**

## Core Technology

### ggwave
**SonarLink is built upon ggwave - Audio Data Transmission Library**

**Description:**
ggwave is a C++ library that allows data transmission over sound waves. It encodes and decodes binary data into/from audio waveforms, enabling applications to transfer information through speakers and microphones.

**Reference Implementation:**
This project was inspired by the ggwave-js example:
https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave/tree/master/examples/ggwave-js

**Community Request:**
SonarLink implements the feature requested in ggwave Issue #41 (June 2021):
"Sending files purely via sound" - https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave/issues/41

## Relationship to Other ggwave Projects

SonarLink implements a long-requested feature from the ggwave community: **pure audio-based file transfer without network connections**. While other projects in the ggwave ecosystem use sound for different purposes, SonarLink is unique in transferring files entirely through audio.

### Related Projects (For Reference)

**Official ggwave Projects:**

1. **wave-share** - WebRTC File Sharing with Audio Signaling
   - Repository: https://github.com/ggerganov/wave-share
   - Author: Georgi Gerganov
   - Purpose: Uses sound **only for signaling** to establish WebRTC connection
   - File Transfer: Via WebRTC/TCP over network
   - Difference: SonarLink transfers files **entirely through sound**, no network needed

2. **Waver** - Official GUI Application
   - Website: https://waver.ggerganov.com
   - Author: Georgi Gerganov
   - Purpose: Send/receive short messages via sound
   - Limitation: 140-character messages, uses TCP for file transfers
   - Difference: SonarLink supports up to 10MB files via pure audio with encryption

**Community Projects:**

3. **data_over_sound** - Python Text Messaging GUI
   - Repository: https://github.com/denizsincar29/data_over_sound
   - Author: denizsincar29
   - Purpose: GUI for text messages via sound
   - Status: File transfer feature was removed and not reimplemented
   - Difference: SonarLink has complete file transfer functionality

4. **ggwave-fm** - Radio Transmission
   - Repository: https://github.com/rgerganov/ggwave-fm
   - Author: rgerganov
   - Purpose: Transmit ggwave messages via SDR/radio frequencies
   - Difference: Extended range transmission vs local audio

5. **ggwave-python** - Python Wrapper
   - Repository: https://github.com/Abzac/ggwave-python
   - Author: Abzac
   - Purpose: Alternative Python bindings for ggwave
   - Difference: Low-level library vs complete application

### What SonarLink Adds

SonarLink is the **first complete implementation** that addresses the community request for pure audio file transfer:

- âœ… **Pure Audio Transfer**: No network, no TCP, no WebRTC - just sound
- âœ… **Large File Support**: Up to 10MB with chunking protocol
- âœ… **Encryption**: AES-256 and RSA-2048 encryption options
- âœ… **Compression**: Automatic GZIP compression
- âœ… **Error Detection**: HMAC verification and corrupt file recovery
- âœ… **Multiple Files**: Batch transfer support
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Cross-platform installers, comprehensive docs
- âœ… **User Friendly**: Interactive CLI with clear prompts

**Key Quote from Issue #41:**
> "This project is exactly what I was looking for except the limitation for message length and the transfer of files. I suggest the possibility of sending files purely over sound, without any additional type of connection."

**SonarLink is the answer to this 3-year-old request.**

## Acknowledgments

### Primary Attribution
**This project would not exist without ggwave.** The core functionality of encoding binary data into audio waveforms and decoding audio back into data is entirely provided by the ggwave library created by Georgi Gerganov.

### Community Inspiration
Special thanks to the ggwave community for:
- **Issue #41** - Identifying the need for pure audio file transfer
- **Discussions** - Providing feedback on protocols and use cases
- **Testing** - Community members testing ggwave in various scenarios

### What SonarLink Contributes
SonarLink builds upon ggwave by providing:
- User-friendly command-line interface
- File compression (gzip)
- Multiple encryption methods (AES-256, RSA-2048)
- HMAC authentication for data integrity
